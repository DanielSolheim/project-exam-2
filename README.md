#NB!
I had some problems on the last day so here are the things that is not quite finished or problems on the website:

I have not set up validation for the forms. I had so many problems with them the last day that i just had to remove the validation. So the forms are sending if you fill them out or not. If the form is submitted while its empty it will just display empty boxes on the parts that are displaying the information.

I had a plugin in chrome that hindered the update of the forms. Just be aware if you are using chrome that that can happen.
